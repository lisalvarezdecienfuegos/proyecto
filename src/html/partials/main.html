    <p>During the last 5 years I have had the pleasure to rock climb in many places in the world that IÂ´ve put together including a brief description for anyone who's wondering where to go rock climbing next!</p>

    <p>As a new web developer, I am hoping to be improving this site's code quite often adding new functionalities and surely changing the design for the better.</p>
